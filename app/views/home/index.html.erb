	<p>Hello there! My name is John Dunham and I love making games! My background is in Computer Science, but my passion lies in interface design and implementation. 
	At the present I am pursuing my Masters at RIT's school of Interactive Games and Media, predominantly researching VR through experiments with the Oculus Rift. 
	If you think you'd be intereseted in the journey give my <a href="http://www.johndunhamgames.com/blog">Research Blog</a> a once over and be sure to tell me what you think!</p>			
	<p>If you just can't get enough of me I also have a <a href="https://github.com/mew2057/">github account</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jfdunham">linkedin account</a> (Don't forget to add me!).</p>
